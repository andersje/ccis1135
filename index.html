</h4>

<h4>Text and References</h4>

This class is taught without a textbook.  Instead, a large number of online articles are referenced.  The student is expected to use online and offline resources to supplement classroom material.

<h4>Special Course Requirements</h4>

Students who have not taken the prerequisite course(s) are responsible for obtaining permission from the instructor to register for advanced coursework requiring those prerequisites.  Students are required to read, sign and date an Internet policy.  A reasonable grasp of English is required, as is some degree of competence in typing.  Hunt-and-peck typers will find the Linux courses particularly challenging.

<h4>Technology</h4>

All students in Computer Careers courses will sign an Internet Policy form, reminding them of the consequences of inappropriate actions while using the Internet.

<h4>Instructional Methods</h4>

 

<p>Student responsibilities include regular attendance, punctuality, positive relationships with other students and staff, appropriate behavior and attitude and acceptable progress.
</p>
<p>All assignments are listed on the syllabus.  It is the student's responsibility to ensure that assignments are complete and given to the instructor when due.  Assignments will be accepted before they are due, but may not be graded immediately.</p>

<p>To do well in this course, you should attend lectures, complete your assignments, review the lecture presentations and your own notes.  Check the class website:  <a href="http://ccis1135.linux-classes.com/">http://ccis1135.linux-classes.com/</a>   If you need assistance, ask the instructor for help. 	</p>

<h4>Course Scheduling</h4>

<p>The scheduled hours of instruction include sixteen hours for each lecture credit.  Lecture credit may include formal or impromptu lectures, demonstrations or discussions with the entire class or with small groups or individuals.  This summer session course will have 8 scheduled in-class periods, with the remaining activities to be completed online.  Online activities will include take-home labs, reading and research.</p>

<h4>Course Calendar</h4>

<h5>Please note that all reading assignments should be completed before the class for which they are listed, with the exception of the first week's reading assignment.</h5>
